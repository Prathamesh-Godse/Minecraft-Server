## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
*   A machine running **Linux** (for manual setup/script) or **Docker**.
*   **SSH access** (for remote servers/VPS).
*   **`sudo` privileges** (for manual setup and script).
*   Basic knowledge of the command line.

## 🛠️ Choose Your Setup Method

### 1. Manual Setup
For those who want to understand every step of the process and have full control over the installation.

**👉 [View the Full Manual Guide](manual-setup.md)**

**Steps Overview:**
1.  SSH into your server
2.  Update system packages
3.  Install Java
4.  Download the Minecraft server jar
5.  Configure the server and accept the EULA
6.  Run the server as a system service

### 2. Automated Bash Script
For a faster setup that automates the manual process. Perfect for quickly provisioning a new server.

**Location:** `scripts/setup.sh`

**Usage:**
```bash
# 1. Download the script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YourUsername/Minecraft-Server/main/scripts/setup.sh

# 2. Make it executable
chmod +x setup.sh

# 3. Run the script (review the code first!)
./setup.sh
```
**⚠️ Important:** Always review scripts from the internet before running them.

### 3. Docker Container
For the most portable and isolated deployment. Ideal for running on any system that has Docker installed.

**Location:** `docker/`

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Clone the repo and navigate to the docker directory
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Minecraft-Server.git
cd Minecraft-Server/docker

# Copy the example environment file and configure it
cp example.env .env
nano .env # Edit your variables (e.g., MEMORY, VERSION)

# Start the server in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

# View the logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

## 🔧 Common Configuration

After setup, regardless of method, you will likely want to configure your server:
*   Edit `server.properties` to change game settings (difficulty, PvP, etc.).
*   Add operators (admins) to the `ops.json` file.
*   Add players to the `whitelist.json` file to restrict access.
*   Adjust the allocated RAM in your startup command or script (`-Xmx` flag).

*   **[Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Server.properties)**: Official documentation for all `server.properties` options.
